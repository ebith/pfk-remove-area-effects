Dismiss Area Effect
===

This mod adds a key to dismiss area effects, bound to "L" by default. It that can only be used outside of combat.  The combat log will show the results of using it.

*Note: this was tested against the PF:K 2.0.5c.

Installation:

1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21) and point it at your Pathfinder: Kingmaker game directory (if using Steam, this will typically be at:
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathfinder Kingmaker\`)
2. Use UMM to install the mod by dragging and dropping the zip file into its Mods tab.

This is built upon the Dismiss Area Effect Spell from [Eldritch Arcana](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/79), an excellent mod by Elmindra / [jennyem](https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods).

[Turn-Based Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/109?tab=description) is the reason I bought this game.

[Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26) was useful both in testing and for some of the menu code.


The original Credits from Eldritch Arcana follow as they cover the essentials rather well:

I wanted to thank some other projects that made this mod possible.

[Custom Blueprints](https://github.com/spacehamster/KingmakerCustomBlueprints/)
was a huge help, making it easy easy to view the game's blueprints and see how they're implemented.

[Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26)
was a huge help playtesting features (and it's generally a great quality of life mod).

[Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/) and
[Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) are what makes mods like this possible.

And of course, thanks to [Owlcat Games](https://owlcatgames.com/) for making such a fun game based
on Pathfinder, that inspired me to get into modding!

Last but not least, thanks to players who've given me ideas and inspiration for things to focus on.
