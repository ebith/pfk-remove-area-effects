Remove Area Effects
===

Some area effect spells and traps in the game last a very long time and the only way around it is to use Dispel Magic, to wait it out, or worse to save scum that trap.

This mod adds a key to remove area effects, bound to "L" by default but the key may be changed in the Options menu.  Only area effects that hinder the player and last for a long time are handled by this mod - see the list of effects below.  The intent is to lessen irritation, not to neuter area effect spells.

There are two modes for the removal itself, one of which speeds up time passing until effects expire and the other directly removes the effects.  The former mode is exactly the same as waiting for the spell to expire in the game , but you don't lose real world time doing so - this is the default mode.

Modes
----
There are two modes for removal: **Wait** and **Dismiss**.
1. **Wait**  In Wait mode your party will wait to where effects expire normally. Game time will skip forward to that point. There is an optional setting to prevent weariness from increasing in this mode (defaults to off).
2. **Dismiss**  In Dismiss mode, all effects are immediately dismissed with no extra time passing.  There is an optional setting to allow this to be done in combat (defaults to off).

This is built upon the Dismiss Area Effect Spell from [Eldritch Arcana](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/79), an excellent mod by Elmindra / [jennyem](https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods).

[Turn-Based Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/109?tab=description) is the reason I bought this game.

[Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26) was useful both in testing and for some of the menu code.


The original Credits from Eldritch Arcana follow as they cover the essentials rather well:

I wanted to thank some other projects that made this mod possible.

[Custom Blueprints](https://github.com/spacehamster/KingmakerCustomBlueprints/)
was a huge help, making it easy easy to view the game's blueprints and see how they're implemented.

[Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26)
was a huge help playtesting features (and it's generally a great quality of life mod).

[Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/) and
[Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) are what makes mods like this possible.

And of course, thanks to [Owlcat Games](https://owlcatgames.com/) for making such a fun game based
on Pathfinder, that inspired me to get into modding!

Last but not least, thanks to players who've given me ideas and inspiration for things to focus on.
